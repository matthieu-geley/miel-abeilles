Here are some ways you could optimize the bee colony optimization code:

- Use Numpy vectors and operations instead of basic Python lists and loops where possible. This will speed up things like calculating distances.

- Limit copying of lists. For example, in `repopulate()`, you could generate the child bee lists in place rather than making copies. 

- Reduce overall complexity. Some parts like `move()` seem more complex than needed. You may be able to simplify the logic.

- Add flexibility for parameters like population size, number of generations, etc to be set as inputs rather than hardcoding.

- Use memoization to cache computed fitness values rather than recomputing.

- Parallelize fitness evaluation and breeding steps across bees.

- Optimize data layout to improve locality and cache utilization. For example store flowers and bees in separate contiguous arrays.

- Profile the code to identify hot spots and focus optimization there. 

- Consider moving the expensive inner loops like fitness evaluation to compiled code (C/C++ extension or Numba) rather than plain Python.

- Use more efficient data structures like Sets vs Lists in some places.

- Reduce number of copies made, reuse objects where possible.

So in summary, leverage Numpy, reduce complexity, parallelize, use memoization and caching, profile and optimize hotspots, and consider moving inner loops to compiled code. That should help significantly speed up the implementation.

Based on a quick analysis of the bee colony optimization code you provided:

The overall big O is dominated by the `repopulate()` method, which is O(n^2) due to the nested loops over the bees lists to select random parents and generate offspring.

Specifically:

- `generate()` is O(n) where n is the population size. Simple loop to generate bees.

- `move()` is O(n) where n is number of flowers. Calculates fitness.

- `evaluate()` is O(n log n) due to sorting the bees by fitness.

- `repopulate()` is O(n^2) as explained above. Two nested loops over bees.

- `mutate()` is O(1). Mutates a single random bee.

- `average()` is O(n) to calculate average fitness.

- `visualize_best_bee()` is O(n) to plot bee path. 

- `visualize_average_generation()` is O(n) to plot fitness over generations.

So the repopulation step dominates with O(n^2) complexity. The overall algorithm is likely running in O(g * n^2) time where g is the number of generations.

Some ways to improve this:

- Use a more efficient parent selection and breeding approach.

- Parallelize the loops to reduce effective time complexity.

- Reduce number of generations g.

- Limit population size n per generation.
